# Predict-Flu-Vaccination
Enhanced influenza vaccination strategies using tailored machine learning models on National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey data for improved performance using Python.

Refined influenza vaccination strategies via predictive modeling, leveraging National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey dataset. Developed machine learning algorithms tailored to each vaccine and ensured data integrity was maintained through meticulous data preprocessing. Tuned hyperparameters of each model using Grid Search Cross-Validation to minimize computational resources spent and maximize ROC AUC performance.
